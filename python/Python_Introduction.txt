Basics:

	almost everything is a reference
	local vs global variables
		local variable "masks" : A global variable cannot be changed directly from within another function.
		global frame: variables defined in the main function
		global   
			global x -> x = 3
	
	Functions:
		positional arguments vs keyword arguments
		func?	for help -> print?
		pass 	for empty blocks

		Function as Argument:
			sort():	products.sort(key = order_by_price)	# def order_by_price(item: tuple) -> return item[1]
			this allows us to define the criteria for sorting

			order_by_price() -> reference to return value
			order_by_price   -> reference to function

	__name__ : 
			name of the function being executed 
			"__main__" if program executed on its own 
			if module imported to some other then same if name of the file

	Conditonal:	
			if item in collection 
			a if [condition] else b 	# this can be nested as well

	for:		
			for -> else : 				if loop executed fully then else; if terminated in between then else not executed
			zip():  					returns zip object iterator of tuples
			enumerate(): 				returns enumerate object iterator adds a counter to the collection passed	
			in, range();		 		for item in collection; collection can't be changed when traversing through for loop
			att for att in 
			# for l in reversed(range(L - 1))
	
	Packing
		*args: 		variable number of position argumeents to a funciton. collects all into a tuple
		**kwargs:	arbitrary keyword arguments. collects into a dictionary	

	Unpacking: 
			x, y, z = coordinates # some list or tuple 
		`*` for Extended Unpacking
				first, second, *other = numbers
				first, *middle, last = numbers
		Unpacking with Function Arguments:
			when passing list/tuple to funciton `*` unpacks collection into individual positional arguments. 
				def add (a, b, c)	->	add(*three_numbers)
			simillarly keyword arguments can be unpacked
				def info(name, age, city)	-> display_info(**some_dictionary)
				greet(*args, **kwargs) -> args = ['Hello'], kwargs = {'name': 'Alice'}

Data Structures:

	type()
		returns Type object, represents type of object passed

	sorted/.sort(key, reverse); 
	min/max(key) -> key: 
		criteria for ordering. pass function as an argument

	slicing:	
		slice(3, 6) == [3, 6]
		[::-1], [3: 7: 2], [6:2:-1], [:]

	str():	"",'' 
			immutable (int, bool, float)
			len(), .strip(), .rstrip(), .lstrip(), .find(), . contains(), .count(), .replace(), .isupper(), .split(), 
			.join(): 	
				string from a list containing strings, with a separating character 
					sorted(strings, key = lambda word: "".join([c for c in word if c in "aeiou"]))
			r"" // R"" :	raw string literal -> treat backslashes '\' as literal characters, not as escape characters
					"C:\\Users\\Anush" vs r"C\Users\Name"

			Formatting:
				`,`			adds white space
				`f"{}"`		
					.format()
						template = 'Column "{0}" has {1:.2%} missing values'
						print(template.format(col, np.isnan(D[col]).mean()))
				
	
	list():	[] 	
			mutable. variable stores the reference to the list. when assigned to another -> the reference if copied; passed by reference
			.append(), .insert(), .pop(), .count(), .remove(object_reference), del _list[index], clear(), in, .sort(), , sorted(), max(), min(), sum(), len(), multidim lists stored as rows m[i][j], id(), copy_list = list[:] (copy list, [:] selects all items); my_list[1:3] = [10, 20]
			list1 + list2 -> concatanates lists
			import copy -> copy.deepcopy()

	dict(): {} 	
			hash table. key -> value. keys must be immutable (must be hasable)(list can't be keys). 
			for key in dicitonary. for key, value in dictionary.items()
			del dictionary[key], deleted = staff.pop['David', None]. staff.clear()
	
	tuple(): () 	
			immutable ordered collecttion. not needed when defining tuples -> numbers = 1, 2, 3; basically comma seprated values.  immutable so can use as keys
			when returning multiple values -> function returns  a tuple of those values that can be assigned to multiple variables. EG: (min_value, max_value) = minmax(my_list)
			dictionary.items() -> (key, values) tuples
			list of tuples by default sorted by the first item
			number1, number2 = number2, number1 , can be done because of tuples

	set(): {}	
			unordered mutable collection of unique elements. 
			.add(), .remove(), in, `|` (union), `&` (intersection), `-` (difference), `^` (symmetric difference - elements present in either sets but not both)



Exception Handling:

	try: 	code that might raise an exception
	except:	executes if specific exception occurs 
		here both exeptions are handeled seperately
			except ZeroDivisionError as e:
				print(f"Error occured: {e}")
			except ValueError as e:
				print(f"Invalid input! Please enter an integer.")
	else:	executes if no exceptions occur in `try`
	finally: always executes
	raise:	exeption. also if used within except block without arguments -> raises current exception
	raises:	function/ method raises exeption
	Exception Class: can define custom exceptions by subclassing it

	errors: 	syntax vs runtime: try , except, raise
			ValueError -> float('1,23') value passed to a function invalid
			TypeError -> len(10) value passed of wrong type len needs string/list
			IndexError
			ZeroDivisionError -> sum(my_list) / len(my_list)
			FileNotFoundError -> accessing file which doesn't exist
			io.UnsupportedOperation -> rying to perform an operation on a file which is not supported by the mode in which the file is opened
			PermissionError -> program lacks necessary permision to access the file
	
			passing exceptions -> funciton causes an exception but not handled so passed on the previous stack location till reaches main function location.
			raise an exception: makes debugging easier. when detecting invalid parameters. raise ValueError("The input was negative: " + str(n))





File Handling:
	
	open():	returns file object
		file_object = open("filename", "mode")
		mode: `r`, `w` (creates new file/truncates existing), `a` (append), `b` (binary mode, `rb`, `wb`), 'x' (creates, if exist raise exception)
	close(): close the file 
		file_object.close()
	with:	ensures file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exeption is raise
		with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
	read():		content = file.read()
					read(10)	# reads the first 10 characters
					read(size = -1) # reads up to `size` bytes from the file
	readlines(): reads all lines into a list
	write(string): wrties entire content if open in `w` or appends if open in `a`
	writeLines(lines): writes list of lines to file	
	read line by line: 
		for line in file:
	tell():	current file position
		print(file.tell())
	seek():	changes file positon
		file.seek(5)	# moves file cursor to 5th byte
	Example	
	def copy_lines(source_file: str, target_file: str, criterion= lambda x: True):
    		with open(source_file) as source, open(target_file, "w") as target:
        		for line in source:
            			line = line.strip()
            			if criterion(line):
                			target.write(line + "\n")

	import json:
		json.dump(data, file)	# writing to JSON file
		data = json.load(file)	# reading	
	
	import csv:
		csv_reader = csv.reader(file)		# for row in csv_reader:
		csv.writer(file).writewrows(data)
		csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)	# for row in csv_reader:
		csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames).writeheader().writerows(data)

	import pandas as pd:
		df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx')
		df = pd.DataFrame(data)			# df.to_excel('example.xlsx', index = False)

	import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
		tree = ET.parse('example.xml')
		root = tree.getroot()			# for child in root: print(child.tag, child.attrib)
		
	with, as, open(), .read(), 'w',  'a', write(), (pass, .close()) -< can use to empty a file
		with open("example.txt") as new_file: # new_file: file handle -> pointer to position in a file. once we reach the end we can't use it again. so therefore better to store contents in a variable
			contents = new_file.read()
 			for line in new_file:	# go through the lines

		with open("file_to_be_cleared.txt", "w") as my_file: 	# open and delete a file; 'pass' cuz python doesn't allow empty blocks
    			pass
		open(filename, 'w').close()
		os.remove("unnecessary_file.csv")	# delete a file

		import csv; csv.reader(my_file, delimiter=';') -> returns lists
		import json; courses = json.loads(my_file.read())
